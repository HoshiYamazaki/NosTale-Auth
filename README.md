# NosTale-Auth
Simple library that lets you generate "magic" value for the NoS0577 login packet

# The packet
New login packet `NoS0577` is used when you login with GameForge launcher

That's how it looks like:
`"NoS0577 " + SESSION_GUID + " " + username + " " + INSTALLATION_GUID + " 003662BF" + char(0xB) + "0.9.3.3103" + " 0 " + MD5_STR(MD5_FILE("NostaleClientX.exe") + MD5_FILE("NostaleClient.exe"))`

* `NoS0577` - The header of the packet, const value
* `SESSION_GUID` - Value generated by this library
* `USERNAME` - Your account username
* `INSTALLATION_GUID` - Id that is generated during installation, for login purpuroses it probably may be random, stored in the windows registry under key name `InstallationId` in `SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Gameforge4d\\TNTClient\\MainApp`
* `003662BF` - Random value converted to HEX
* `char(0xB)` - Single character with ASCII code `0xB`
* `0.9.3.3103` - Current version of client, may be obtained from the NostaleClientX.exe file version
* `0` - const value
* `MD5_STR(MD5_FILE("NostaleClientX.exe") + MD5_FILE("NostaleClient.exe"))` - MD5 generated from concatenation of MD5 strings of NostaleClientX.exe and NostaleClient.exe
